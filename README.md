# Tyrone-Bot

**Context (Why Does This Exist):**

Tyrone Bot (Tyrone 2.0) is powered by the discord.py library as well as https://uptimerobot.com/. It features voice support for trolling your fellow mates. Easy to follow. I suggest you this as a template for your own code on IDEs like Visual Studio.

**Bot Mechanics: (Prefix = "dude")**

- Join: Joins the voice channel that the user is in & plays a really loud clash royale sound
- Leave: Leaves the voice channel that it is currently in 
- Pause: Stops the really loud clash royale sound it is currently playing

**Note: It has recently occurred to me that discord.py will be deprecated by April of 2022. As of 2/27/2022, I am rewriting Tyrone Bot to adapt to NextCord, another python library for discord**
