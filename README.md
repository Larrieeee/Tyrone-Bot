# Tyrone-Bot

**Context (Why Does This Exist):**

Tyrone Bot is powered by the discord.py library as well as https://uptimerobot.com/ and contains commands designed for the memers and trolls. Some commands include but are not limited to: *PRANK, TOMFOOLERY, YOO, PPCOUNT*.

**Bot Mechanics:**

- Help Me Tyrone: Displays a couple of the commands in case you forgot the syntax 
- Prank: Use this command at your own risk
- Tomfoolery: The definition of spam pinging
- PPcount: Tyrone counts infinity penises
- Yoo: This runs everytime someone says yoo and responds with a "yoo what's good"
- Merry: Merry Christmas 

**Note: It is worth noting that like bascially everything nowadays, it records your message data across all the servers you invite it into. So yeah..**
