# Tyrone-Bot

**Context (Why Does This Exist):**

Tyrone Bot (Tyrone 2.0) is powered by the discord.py library as well as https://uptimerobot.com/ and contains commands designed for the memers and trolls. Some commands include but are not limited to: ____

**Bot Mechanics:**

- Work in progress
- Tyrone is being revamped and rewritten becuase his old code was damn ugly

**Note: It has recently occured to me that discord.py will be depricated by April of 2022. As of 2/27/2022, I am rewriting Tyrone Bot to adapt to nextcord, another python library for discord**
